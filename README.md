## 🔒 Private Projects

Besides the repositories shown on this profile, I also manage **private repositories in Azure DevOps**, where I work on advanced projects such as:

- 🎮 **Unreal Engine 5** (game systems, plugin integration, and procedural generation).
- 🖥️ Enterprise applications and custom solutions built with **.NET, Rust, and Next.js**.
- ⚙️ Full team workflows using **Azure Boards and Pipelines** (CI/CD).

Due to confidentiality, these repositories are not public, but they are an active part of my professional experience.
